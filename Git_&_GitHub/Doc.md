#### _Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). It's a tool that helps developers track changes in their source code over time. Git allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously and merge their changes efficiently._

<div><b><u>KeyFeatures</u> : </b></div> 

+ Version Control: Git tracks changes to files, allowing you to access previous versions and see the history of the code.
+ Branching: Git enables the creation of branches for parallel development, making it easy to work on new f eatures or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
+ Merging: Git facilitates the merging of changes from different branches back into the main branch.
+ Distributed: Each developer has a full copy of the project's history, which makes it robust and allows for offline work.

##### _Developers use Git for managing and tracking changes in their codebase. Git is primarily a command-line tool, but it also has graphical user interfaces available._

#### _GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git. It adds a social and collaborative aspect to version control. It's used for hosting and sharing Git repositories, collaborating with others, and managing projects._

<div><b><u>KeyFeatures</u> : </b></div> 

+ Remote Repository Hosting: GitHub provides a place to host Git repositories on the cloud, making it easy to share code with others.
+ Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously, making changes through pull requests and discussions.
+ Issue Tracking: GitHub has built-in issue tracking for managing and prioritizing tasks and bugs.
+ Web-Based Interface: GitHub offers a user-friendly web interface for interacting with Git repositories, in addition to Git's command-line tools.

##### _GitHub is a platform where developers collaborate on open-source and private projects, share code, manage issues, and contribute to various software projects. It's widely used for open-source contributions and collaborative development._

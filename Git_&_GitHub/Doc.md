#### _Git is a distributed version control system (VCS). It's a tool that helps developers track changes in their source code over time. Git allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously and merge their changes efficiently._

<div><b><u>KeyFeatures</u> : </b></div> 

+ Version Control: Git tracks changes to files, allowing you to access previous versions and see the history of the code.
+ Branching: Git enables the creation of branches for parallel development, making it easy to work on new f eatures or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
+ Merging: Git facilitates the merging of changes from different branches back into the main branch.
+ Distributed: Each developer has a full copy of the project's history, which makes it robust and allows for offline work.

##### _Developers use Git for managing and tracking changes in their codebase. Git is primarily a command-line tool, but it also has graphical user interfaces available._
